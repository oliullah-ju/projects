This research presents a pioneering approach for fresh fruit and vegetable identification through IoT and a hybrid deep learning model, combining EfficientNetB7 and ResNet50 architectures. The proposed hybrid model demonstrates remarkable accuracy, achieving 99.92% and 95.93% precision on dataset1 and dataset2, respectively. study encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of four initial models: EfficientNetB7, VGG16, ResNet50, and VGG19. The hybrid model, which combines the best of these, performed better than the others. In addition to its high accuracy.
